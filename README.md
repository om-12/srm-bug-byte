srm developing challenge

HELLO Sir/Ma'am
Firstly i would like to apologize for changing the project's idea because one of my team's member has left because of some family problems.
He was key to the project,We hope you will understand our problem and let us allow to be one of the competeting teams in this challenge.

INTRODUCTION 
Charity is an act of kindness, where a person who has financially more than enough of what he or she needs contributes a part of his or her surplus income for the fulfilment of the needs of those who are less capable. The majority of millitary organisations has experienced difficulties in getting funds or other required things.In current scenerio ,in a pandemic situation people are coming forward and helping the needy one and there is no site which helps in funding of all kind of army organisations. Getting donor is a very hard task, and sometime dealing with some donor’s conditions can be a big challenge for any funds related to indian army to fulfill it. This charity management system will help defence funds to find donors easily. This system has three modules namely, Admin, members and Donor. Admin can login using credentials and manage the request raised by members by approving or rejecting it. members can view the previous events list and donation report. Donor can simply donate without any preregisteration and can choose whether they want to disclose their name or not.This site will also help in fund raising events and ofcourse online fundraising.


WHY THIS IDEA?
 UK fundraising reports that “17% of online donations were made on a mobile device in 2016 versus 14% in 2015″.One of the big reasons are when you will search for the sites like ours(donate to army organisations) you will find that there only 2 to 3 sites which are currently active and most of them are very specific ,for eg-national defence fund,
 so we think that our initiative will not only make donations easier for several organisations but also encourage people by managing and hosting events with the help of our members.
