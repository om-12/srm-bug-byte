srm developing challenge


INTRODUCTION 
Charity is an act of kindness, where a person who has financially more than enough of what he or she needs contributes a part of his or her surplus income for the fulfilment of the needs of those who are less capable. The majority of millitary organisations has experienced difficulties in getting funds or other required things.In current scenerio ,in a pandemic situation people are coming forward and helping the needy one and there is no site which helps in funding of all kind of army organisations. Getting donor is a very hard task, and sometime dealing with some donor’s conditions can be a big challenge for any funds related to indian army to fulfill it. This charity management system will help defence funds to find donors easily. This system has three modules namely, Admin, members and Donor. Admin can login using credentials and manage the request raised by members by approving or rejecting it. members can view the previous events list and donation report. Donor can simply donate without any preregisteration and can choose whether they want to disclose their name or not.This site will also help in fund raising events and ofcourse online fundraising.


WHY THIS IDEA?
 UK fundraising reports that “17% of online donations were made on a mobile device in 2016 versus 14% in 2015″.One of the big reasons are when you will search for the sites like ours(donate to army organisations) you will find that there only 2 to 3 sites which are currently active and most of them are very specific ,for eg-national defence fund,
 so we think that our initiative will not only make donations easier for several organisations but also encourage people by managing and hosting events with the help of our members.
 
 

 
#features of website
-> user registeration by google,facebook

HELP  TO UNDERSTAND THE WEBSITE

HOMEPAGE - this page consist of navigations to all other contents of site and contains donate now button after motivating by the images.
NEWS- it will contain the data which is recent and related to our website works and current affairs in indian army organisation.
events-it will contain the type of events we can arrange for fundraising.
participation-initially we thought that we could complete this part of project but we are only able to complete the front end
our site supports a good user login register page.
we had tried to get the feed backs of user to let us know what changes we need to do.
we have designed the model but we need to do alot because it is a dynamic site as you can understand.
we have tried for payment gateways too but we did not succeed because late we came to know that we need mcc.
THANKYOU
